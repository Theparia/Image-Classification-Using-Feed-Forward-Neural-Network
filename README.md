# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification

This project consists of two phases. In the first phase, I implemented a feed-forward neural network from scratch but in the second phase, I implemented it using Keras and TensorFlow packages.

## Phase 1

## Phase 2
This phase aims to get more familiar with `Keras` and `TensorFlow` libraries to build a neural network model for predicting the type of animal in a given image using the `Oregon Wildlife` dataset, including four categories, namely `elk`, `raven`, `bald_eagle` and `raccoon`.
### Objectives
- Preprocessing, including grayscaling the images and one hot encoding of labels
- Neural network implementation
- Data classification and evaluating the impacts of optimizer, number of epochs, loss function, and regularization
- Dimensionality reduction for data visualization
