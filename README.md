# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification

This project consists of two phases.

## Phase 1

## Phase 2
This phase aims to get more familiar with Keras and TensorFlow libraries to build a neural network model for predicting the type of animal in a given image using `Oregon Wildlife` dataset, including four categories, namely `elk`, `raven`, `bald_eagle` and `raccoon`.
